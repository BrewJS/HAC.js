# Brew.js for Nintendo Switch

## What is __Brew.js__?
    Brew.js is a JavaScript API for Nintendo systems, Nintendo Switch in this case, plus an interpreter to execute sources written in JS. Currently only Switch is supported, but a 3DS version well be released soon.

## What do I need?
- The interpreter (NRO ROM, loaded from Homebrew) on the [releases page](<release>)
- Documentation [saved here](<doc>)
- An IDE or text editor to write code (I suggest using [Visual Studio Code](Release/Brew.js.nro) or [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download))
